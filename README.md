# c-basic
This Repository features C source code i wrote to learn c. Currently the most advanced program included is an
unfinished implementation of the huffman algorithm.

Some programs make use of outdated and unsafe functions such as gets() or scanf(), which **should never be used**.
That is the case, because we were teached to use some of these in programming classes. Ideally, all uses
of these unsafe functions should include a comment explaining why this is bad and also include and implemented
alternative, but that may not always be the case.

All code in this Repository was written on and for a Linux x86_64 system. It might not work on other systems.
